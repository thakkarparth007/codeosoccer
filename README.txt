There is a lot of dead code. There's no intention of cleaning it up anytime soon. However, most of the code lies in Game.hpp, States.hpp and Attacker.hpp. The skills.hpp/skills.cpp file was modified - some constants were changed in the path planner to make the bots faster. However, that lead to a slightly weird motion - their paths became more curved than before, but it helped a lot in dribbling, and hence that effect was in a way good for us.
